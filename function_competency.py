#Competency. Test your ability to create functions. 
#Create these functions by yourself.

#Objective: Calculate the tax, add it to the cost, print the total.
#Requirements:
# Create two functions. 
# Function 1 calculates the tax using the cost provided and a default
# tax rate or a rate passed in. 
# Function 2 calculates the total from the cost and the calculated tax.
# Print out the total

#Function 1 details
#  Function Name: "CalculateTax"
#  Parameter(s): cost, taxRate (this is a default parameter with the value of .07)
#  Return: float
#  Example Input 1: 100
#  Example Return 1: 7.0
#  Example Input 2: 50, .1
#  Example Return 1: 5.0

##Function 2 details
#  Function Name: "CalculateTotal"
#  Parameter(s): cost, tax
#  Return: float
#  Example Input 1: 100, 7
#  Example Return 1: 107
#  Example Input 2: 50, 5
#  Example Return 1: 55
#
#NOTE: You will need to pass the value returned from function 1 into function 2

#Define the functions here


#Call the functions and save the results to the variables below.
tax =    
total1 = 

tax = 
total2 = 

#Do not edit below here:
print(total1)
print(total2)
#The output should be:
#107.0
#55.0
